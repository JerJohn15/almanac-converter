Gregorian Calendar
------------------
The Gregorian Calendar is internationally the most widely used civil calendar. It was named for Pope Gregory XIII who introduced it on October 15, 1582. The calendar was a refinement to the Julian Calendar, with the motivation of setting the Easter holiday to a specific date instead of the spring equinox, which naturally drifted dates.

Each year is divided into 12 months, with a varied number of days per month. To account for the drift in seasons, a leap year occurs which introduces an additional day in February. These leap years happen every year that's divisible by 4, except years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. For example: 1700, 1800 and 1900 are NOT leap years, but 2000 is a leap year.

Julian Day
----------
The continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period, the Julian Day is primarily used by astronomers for easier calculations. The Julian Day Number (JDN) is the integer assigned to a whole solar day starting from noon Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), with day 0 assigned to noon on January 1, 4713 BC on the proleptic Julian Calendar. The Julian Day (JD) is the preceding JDN plus the fraction of the day.

French Republican Calendar
--------------------------
The French Republican Calendar (FRC) was a calendar created and implemented during the French Revolution. It was only used in practice for 12 years from late 1793 to 1806 as part of an ongoing effort by Napoleon to reinstate the catholic church within France following the Concordat of 1801. This calendar was picked up briefly during the Paris Commune of 1871. Each year is divided into 12 months, with each month being an equal 30 days long. Every year begins on the autumnal equinox as observed in Paris. The eccentricity of Earth's wobble and varying eclipctic orbit required an additional 5-6 additional "Sans-culottides" dates to account for this.
