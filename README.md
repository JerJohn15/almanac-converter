Converts seamlessly between a number of known calendars.

Gregorian Calendar
------------------
Also called the Western Calendar, or the Christian Calendar, it is the most internationally widely used civil calendar. Introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 as a refinement to the Julian Calendar, this calendar divided the year into 12 months of varying lengths of 30 and 31 days, with the second month having either 28 or 29 days every fourth year (with the exception of 1900).

Julian Day
----------
The continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period, the Julian Day is primarily used by astronomers for easier calculations. The Julian Day Number (JDN) is the integer assigned to a whole solar day starting from noon Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), with day 0 assigned to noon on January 1, 4713 BC on the proleptic Julian Calendar. The Julian Day (JD) is the preceding JDN plus the fraction of the day.

French Republican Calendar
--------------------------
The French Republican Calendar (FRC) was a calendar created and implemented during the French Revolution. It was only used in practice for 12 years from late 1793 to 1806 as part of an ongoing effort by Napoleon to reinstate the catholic church within France following the Concordat of 1801. This calendar was picked up briefly during the Paris Commune of 1871. Each year is divided into 12 months, with each month being an equal 30 days long. Every year begins on the autumnal equinox as observed in Paris. The eccentricity of Earth's wobble and varying eclipctic orbit required an additional 5-6 additional "Sans-culottides" dates to account for this.
