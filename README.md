Why Almanac-Converter?
----------------------
Almanac Converter expands on pre-existing robust date libraries and enables two-way conversion between various calendars. 

Gregorian Calendar
------------------
The Gregorian Calendar is internationally the most widely used civil calendar. It was named for Pope Gregory XIII who introduced it on October 15, 1582. The calendar was a refinement to the Julian Calendar, with the motivation of setting the Easter holiday to a specific date instead of the spring equinox, which naturally drifted dates.

Each year is divided into 12 months, with a varied number of days per month. To account for the drift in seasons, a leap year occurs which introduces an additional day in February. These leap years happen every year that's divisible by 4, except years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. For example: 1700, 1800 and 1900 are NOT leap years, but 2000 is a leap year.

Julian Day
----------
The Julian Day is the continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period used primarily by astronomers. The Julian Period is a chronological interval of 7980 years beginning in 4713 BC, and has been used since 1583 to convert between different calendars. The next Julian Period begins in the year 3268 AD.

French Republican Calendar
--------------------------
The French Republican Calendar (or, erroneously, French Revolutionary Calendar) was a calendar created and used during the French Revolution. It was only used in practice for 12 years starting in late 1793 until it was abolished by Napoleon Bonaparte as an effort to reinstate the catholic church within France. This calendar was later picked up, albeit briefly, during the Paris Commune of 1871.

Each year is divided into 12 months (mois), with each month being an equal 30 days long, divided out further into 3 weeks (d√©cades) 10 days long. Every year begins on the autumnal equinox as observed in Paris. The slight variation in seaons required the use of 5-6 additional "Sans-culottides" days. While the calendar was adopted on October 24, 1793 (3 Brumaire, An II), the official epoch was set to September 22, 1792 (1 Vendemiaire, An I) to commemorate the founding of the republic.
 
To further reduce the influence of the Church, a Rural Calendar was introduced, naming each day of the year after various crops, minerals, animals and work tools to reflect the changing of the seasons. 

Maya Calendar
-------------
The Maya calendar is not one calendar per se, but rather a system of calendars employed by pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. In many modern communities in Guatemala and Mexico, this calendar is still used today.

The Maya calendar consists of several cycles (or counts) of different lengths. The 260-day calendar, or <em>Tzolk'in</em>, was combined with the 365-day calendar, or <em>Haab'</em> to form a synchronized cycle lasting for 52 Haab' called the Calendar Round. To measure periods longer than this, the Maya used the Long Count calendar.
